This tool provides information of the association between the natural variation in the transcript abundance of any gene of interest and either one of the more than 400 environmental variables

TWAS analysis for each of the more than 400 environmental variables in this study was performed using the set 558 accessions within the set of 879 Eurasian accessions in this study that had information on transcript abundance from a previous study (Kawakatsu, Taiji, et al. 2016; DOI: 10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.044)
